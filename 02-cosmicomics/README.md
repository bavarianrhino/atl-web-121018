## Cosmicomics: A Data Structure Story

### SWBATs

* Do basic File I/O (reading)
* Trace data flow in nested loops
* Make simple estimates about program performance/runtime behavior
* Recognize when additional structure makes hashes preferable


### Motivation

* Learning programming is tough. There's too much useful software!
  * (I.e. Finding small but useful problems to solve is tricky.)
* I was reading a book called "Real World Haskell" in 2009
  about a _really funky_ programming language.
* They had a code example mentioning "Cosmicomics" by Italo Calvino.
* I thought Cosmicomics was a "cute" word and wondered how many
  combinations like that might be in common english.
* So I wrote a program to find them all. Today, we will reproduce it.
* We'll may hit some performance problems and try to solve then.



### Functional Tasks

* Determine if two words are anagrams
* Determine if two words can be joined by a common letter
* Determine if a word is "special"
* Read a file to build a "dictionary" or word list
* Search all useful combinations of words to find and print special words
