# Hashketball Review

## Objectives

* Distinguish between data types in Ruby
* Show how to look up documentation for data types in Ruby
* Demonstrate the use of common Array methods
  * `#each`
  * `#map`
  * `#select`
  * `#find`
* Differentiate array methods by their respective return values
* Employ test-driven development best practices in their labs
  * `rspec --fail-fast` handleÂ one error at a time
  * Red, Green, Refactor
  * Make it work (shameless green), make it right, make it fast
* Practice Intentional Debugging
  * Recognize when to use `puts` and when to use `binding.pry`

## Schedule

-  Working with the spec and intro to TDD
-  Intentional Debugging
-  puts vs pry
-  code tracing (scope and types)
-  reading error messages
-  googling effectively
-  Git flow (see a merge conflict)

**Bonus Questions:**

Define methods to return the answer to the following questions:

1. Which player has the most points? Call the method `most_points_scored`.

2. Which team has the most points? Call the method `winning_team`.

3. Which player has the longest name? Call the method `player_with_longest_name`.

**Super Bonus:**

1. Write a method that returns true if the player with the longest name had the most steals. Call the method `long_name_steals_a_ton?`.
