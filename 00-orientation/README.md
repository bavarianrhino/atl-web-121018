### Key points

1. Fail with confidence.
2. Be open with us and each other.
3. There is no finish line.
4. Computing isn't (just) about code.

### What it takes to succeed

#### Failing

--

* [Listen to Julia][julia] Evans.

[julia]: https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/726201450079113216

--

* You're going to hit walls. A lot.
  * (If you don't, this isn't the best use of your time.)

--

* Delight in every wall. Take joy in every bug.

--

* When writing code, we're experimenting constantly (by running it).
  * And we make tons of mistakes. It's great. Learn from mistakes.

---

### What it takes to succeed

#### Vulnerability

--

* You're taking a big chance. I love that.

--

* Ask for help when you need it.
  * And by all means, help each other!
  * But root out misunderstandings, don't reveal answers.

--

* Ask me to explain things til I'm hoarse. Until _you_ are satisfied.

--

* Let us know when you feel underchallenged or totally lost.

--

* Know that I believe you _can_ be a programmer.
  * And there were plenty of times I wondered if I would "make it".

#### Curiosity

--

Peter Norvig says it takes [10 years to become a programmer][norvig].

[norvig]: http://norvig.com/21-days.html

--

I've been doing this a decade and I think that's conservative.

--

Do the prework. Do the labs. Do the homework. Do the projects.

--

But your goal shouldn't be the completion of this course.

--

You won't get jobs by having a certificate from us. You'll get them by knowing how to write programs.

--

Focus on your problem solving process and debugging, not "collecting" all the course content or memorizing a bunch of stuff.

--

> Interviewer: Is studying computer science the best way to prepare to be a programmer?

> Bill Gates: No. The best way to prepare is to write programs and
> study programs others have written. ... You've got to want to be
> in this incredible feedback loop where you get people to tell you
> what you're doing wrong.

* Programmers at Work

#### The Big Picture

--

There are no perfect programs.

Try to understand trade offs more than seek the "right answer".

--

Two very important quotes:

--

> In mathematics we are usually concerned with declarative (what is)> descriptions, whereas in computer science we are usually
> concerned with imperative (how to) descriptions.

--

* Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
  * Again, focus on describing _processes_.
  * Think cooking recipes and good writing as much as mathematics.

--

> Thus, programs should be written for humans to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.

--

* Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
  * You'll spend as much of your career reading code as writing it.
  
---

## Some Expectations

--

* Get a full night's sleep. Get here on time.
* Be responsible adults. Pursue this seriously.
* Be respectful of each other's experiences.
* Enjoy programming with us. :)
